const USAGE = 
`encrypt <key> [ <message> ]

Encrypts <message> using AES and prints the result base64-encoded to stdout.
If <message> is not provided on the command line, it will be read from stdin.
<key> is a string that will be used as the basis for the encryption key.
      It is NOT the encryption key itself. The keys found in gosa-si.conf
      for the individual modules can be used to decrypt those modules'
      messages.
