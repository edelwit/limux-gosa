go-susi
=======
go-susi is a replacement for gosa-si-server and gosa-si-client. go-susi has been written from scratch and has none of the performance and quality issues of its predecessors.

Complete documentation of go-susi and the XML-based protocol GOsa² uses to communicate with it can be found in the
[Operator's Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_j8s2-PBVJLaQzmjrdeh6CVWkzP_viA3Uo7AtFmt8c/view) and the manpages included with the Debian packages (start reading at go-susi(1)).
